A bot is an app that users interact with in a conversational way, using text, graphics (such as cards or images), or speech.
Azure Bot Service is a cloud platform. It hosts bots and makes them available to channels(facebook,slack,etc).

Activity:
Every interaction between the user (or a channel) and the bot is represented as an activity. 
Activities can represent human text or speech, app-to-app notifications, reactions to other messages, and so on.

Turns:
In a conversation, people often speak one-at-a-time, taking turns speaking.
With a bot, it generally reacts to user input.a turn consists of the user's incoming activity to the bot and any activity the bot sends back to the user as an immediate response.
You can think of a turn as the processing associated with the bot receiving a given activity.
For example, a user might ask a bot to perform a certain task. 
The bot might respond with a question to get more information about the task, at which point this turn ends. 
On the next turn, the bot receives a new message from the user that might contain the answer to the bot's question, or it might represent a change of subject or a request to ignore the initial request to perform the task.
